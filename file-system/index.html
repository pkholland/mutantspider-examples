  <h1>File System Test</h1>
  <h2>Status: <code id="statusField">NO-STATUS</code></h2>
  <p>Loading this page will test various aspects of the mutantspider file system code.  The first time
  it runs on your system (or the first time it runs after you have cleared your browser's history cache)
  the browser may tell you the page is requesting permission to store data locally.  Clicking "ok" or
  "yes" will allow the test to run correctly.</p>
  <p>The "persistent" tests exercise your browser's logic for storing information locally across page
  views.  Each time you reload this page it checks for data that it might have written during a previous
  view of this page.  If it finds it, it validates that it is correct and then deletes it.  If it doesn't
  find it, it writes it.  So it flips back and forth between the two states each time you view the page.
  The support for this file system is based on the html5 'IndexedDB' service for a javascript build, and
  Google's 'html5fs' service on a PNaCl build.  You can see which build you are running in the 'Status'
  field at the top of this page.  If your browser doesn't support PNaCl, and doesn't support IndexedDB
  then the test will fail.</p>
  <p>The "resource" tests exercise the build system's ability to copy resource-like files from the build
  machine, into the executable itself in such a way that the code can access the files using standard
  <code>fopen</code> and <code>fread</code> calls.  You can read about how this feature works in the
  <code>mutantspider/src/README.makefile</code> file - search for "Resources".</p>
  <p>The lines below this are the tests that are being tried or information about the testing.  If the
  line is normal, black text then that test passed.  In many cases the code is testing something which
  is supposed to <i>not</i> work - for example writing to a read-only file.  In these cases the test is
  verifying that the operation failed and set errno correctly.  If a line is printed in
  <span class="error">RED</span> then it indicates that the corresponding test failed.  The numbers in
  brackets at the start of each line are the line number in the two corresponding source files
  (persistent_tests.cpp and resource_tests.cpp) that generated the printed line.
  <span class="heading">BOLD</span> lines are just information about the tests. Thes are not tests
  themselves.</p>
  <p>Note that as of this writing the PNaCl libraries tend to incorrectly support access permissions
  in the persistent file system (html5fs) causing failers in these tests.  The asm.js libraries have
  incomplete support for user-installed file systems causing failures to set errno correctly for
  certain cases.  This results in failures in the Resource tests.  The Mutantspider file system
  support code for both asm.js and PNaCl has a missing feature of not reporting when background writes
  to the persistent file system have completed.  The "big_file" persistent tests will show this bug if
  you navigate away from the page too soon after letting it start writing.  The error is reported the
  next time you view the page (when it is in the "Data previously stored" state) as the file size not
  being right.</p>
